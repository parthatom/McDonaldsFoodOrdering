# project
A menu driven ordering system for McDonald's in java .

I created this project for my high school sophomore year computer applications final project back in 2015 when I did not use Git or GitHub.
Hence right now (14th July, 2018) i am just adding the final completed version that I submitted.
It also lacks GUI hence feel free to add it.
The menu maybe outdated because again this was created in 2015.

Thank You.
